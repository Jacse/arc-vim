# Simple VIM navigation for chrome/Arc

This extension does the bare minimum to ease navigation using Vim keys.

## Keys

keys | Action
-- | --
j, k | Move up and down page
gg, G | Move to top or bottom of page
J, K | Move up and down links (useful for google)
H, L |Â Move backwards and forwards in history


## Navigating tabs
It's probably possible to overwrite Arc tab navigation, but I couldn't figure it out in 15 minutes, so I didn't bother.

Instead I have set Arc keybindings to go up/down in tabs and left/right in spaces using cmd+shift+h/j/k/l.
